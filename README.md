chrome automation bot using selenium on python

I created a chrome automation bot using selenium on python, it can do anything we humans can do, read and execute operations like we do.

It has a huge potential. I actually have two bots one which goes through twitter and waits for tweat and as soon as the tweet with the same words come it pings up and then starts the other operations which can be email and other things


The other I created was for my school project, in which it stays online on web.whatsapp.com and if someone not a group, someone individualy messages me, it reads the message and stores it in a local private sql database and if let's say that person messaged like
"where are you, [passcode]" it will read the [passcode] and then will give a special designed response regarding my location and wherebouts like those spy films and also store that onto a special table in the database.
